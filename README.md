# Customer-Data-Cleaning-and-Preparation-for-Targeted-Outreach


### Objective:
The goal of this project was to clean and prepare a customer dataset for analysis by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and redundant information, ensuring the data's accuracy, consistency, and usability.

### Tasks Performed:
1. Identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data uniqueness.  
2. Replaced missing values (`NaN`, `N/a`) in critical columns like `Last_Name` and `Phone_Number` with appropriate placeholders or removed rows with excessive nulls.  
3. Standardized values in columns such as `Paying Customer` (`Yes`, `Y`, `No`, `N`) and `Do_Not_Contact` for consistency.  
4. Removed unnecessary columns like `Not_Useful_Column`.  
5. Ensured column names were consistent and meaningful.  
6. Validated `CustomerID` values as unique integers and resolved inconsistencies in names, addresses, and phone numbers.  
7. Standardized phone number formats to a consistent structure.  
8. Verified logical relationships, such as ensuring `Paying Customer` and `Do_Not_Contact` statuses aligned correctly.  
9. Saved the refined dataset in a structured format for further analysis and use.  


### Outcome:
The dataset is now free of duplicates, standardized, and ready for meaningful analysis, providing a reliable foundation for further data-driven decision-making.
